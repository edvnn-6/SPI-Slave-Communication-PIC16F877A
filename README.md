# SPI-Slave-Communication-PIC16F877A
This project implements SPI communication in Slave mode using the PIC16F877A. It receives 8-bit data from an SPI master and displays it on PORTB. The setup is ideal for testing SPI-based communication between microcontrollers or validating master-slave data exchange.
